          With over than 34,000 games, soundtracks, and films, it would be easy
          for anyone to feel dizzy on entering the largest digital distribution
          platform for PC gaming - but that's not the case. The principle of
          ordering things differently was clearly used here: right when you
          enter, the biggest picture shows one of the best games in the moment -
          maybe the one all your friends are talking about and the one who made
          you access that website -, then with a similar size, but way down,
          there are pictures of other games you may be interested, hinting that
          there are way more than those. Buttons for the menu and website
          browsing are way smaller as the company wants you to click on games
          rather than just to look for them.

          In this example, the South Korean multinational has a very simple and
          clean design (and very white) that has a black button central to the
          screen, creating a contrast and drawing attention to it. Their biggest
          goal is for you and me to “Buy” their products “now”, which explains
          why they decided to use the principle of making it the target area of
          the webpage, drawing way more attention to it than any other button.

          The news-oriented website operated by Vox Media does an amazing job
          minimizing choices for the user - even better on smaller screens than
          it does on my PC for example. Theirs scope of media must be enormous,
          as they frequently news, reviews, podcasts and guidebooks on different
          subjects, but their idea of dividing it in sections could drastically
          enhance the user experience as there will be less options (that may
          expand when you click for a more refined search) at a time to get you
          to the desired place.
